# Can of Books
**Author**: Latherio Kidd and Natalie Stone

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

The Can of Books App is a small web application designed to track and catalog impactful books. The app allows users to record books that have influenced them and discover recommendations for future reading. This project involves building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app with MongoDB as the database and connecting it to a React front-end through an Express server.

## Getting Started

To build and run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the front-end repository (can-of-books-frontend) from [GitHub](https://github.com/AgateHunter/can-of-books-frontend.git).
2. Clone the back-end repository (can-of-books-backend) from [GitHub](back-end-repo-link).
3. Add all team members as collaborators to both repositories.
4. Review and update the .gitignore files, and add blank .env files to prevent sensitive information from being pushed to GitHub.
5. Deploy both the front-end and back-end to the cloud to check for proof-of-life indicators.
6. Update the README.md files in each repository with documentation regarding the lab and the current state of development.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following technologies:
- Front-End: React
- Back-End: Express
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
- State Management: React state
- Styling: Bootstrap
The application uses RESTful API routes for CRUD operations and employs React Router for navigation between Home and About pages.
